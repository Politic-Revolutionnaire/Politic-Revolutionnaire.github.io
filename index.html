				<h4>What is kidney dialysis?</h4>
				<p>Kidney dialysis is used to replace a disfunctional kidney. It helps the blood filter out toxins, electrolytes(dissolved minerals) and metabolytes (waste products
				created when cells use energy). In addition to this kidney dialysis helps the body maintain stable amounts of sodium, calcium and potassium.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>How does kidney dialysis relate to osmosis?</h4>
				<p>Kidney Dialysis is centered around a thin semi-premeable membrane that allows small particles such as water, electrolytes and metabolytes pass through, but
				prevents proteins, and blood cells from passing through. This membrane seperate's a person's blood and a solution called the dialysis solution and allows toxins,
				electrolytes, metabolytes etc. pass through the membrane into the solution which is replaced regularly. </p>
